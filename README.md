# Uncommon-Themes

These are a little collection of themes made by me (David SÃ¡nchez Gregori) for the Pharo IDE.

This is tested on `Pharo 8` and (in the moment of publishing) latest `Pharo 9`.

To load the package:


Execute from the `Playground` or the `Workspace`:
```smalltalk
Metacello new 
	repository: 'github://David5i6/Uncommon-Themes/src';
	baseline: 'UncommonThemes';
	load 	
```

Then go to *Settings* and select a "Uncommon Theme".
